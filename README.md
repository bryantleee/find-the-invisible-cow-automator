# Find the Invisible Cow Automator

Automates finding the invisible cow from the website [Find the Invisible Cow](https://findtheinvisiblecow.com/).   
Currently, the script is hard coded to work with Firefox's fullscreen margins on a Macinotosh.   

Dependencies:
* pyautogui
* pyperclip

First open the website and click "Start Script".
Next, run the script:
```
python find_the_invisible_cow.py
```
You will have a 2 second buffer time to click on the Firefox window again.
